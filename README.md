<img width="2048" height="1127" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73c4c696-52b4-4a11-8cf0-3ac62e46999b" />

# Introduction 
 This project focuses on implementing robust security protocols for a call center. This includes conducting a detailed risk assessment to identify potential threats to the center’s operations, data protection and customer interactions.

---
# Problem Statement
Call centers handle sensitive customer and business information, making them targets for security threats such as unauthorised access, data breaches, and system failures. Currently, there is no comprehensive framework in place to safeguard data and ensure secure operations. This exposes the organisation to risks including data loss, reputational damage, operational downtime and regulatory non-compliance. Emerging threats, remote work setups and third-party integrations further increase the center’s vulnerability. A structured risk assessment is needed to identify, analyse, and prioritise these risks effectively. The findings will guide the implementation of strong security protocols to protect customer data, ensure compliance and maintain business continuity.

# Objectives
- The goal of the risk assessment is to help the client prioritise and implement strong security protocols for their organisation’s call center operation by identifying potential threats that may disrupt the call center’s operations, analyse identified risks and evaluating the approach to manage them methodically.

# Tasks
1. **Perform a Risk Assessment:**
- Identify potential threats that may disrupt the call center’s operations, such as unauthorised access to customer information, system failures, or regulatory compliance issues.
- Analyse the identified risks by assessing their likelihood and potential impact on business operations.
- Prioritise the risks by evaluating their severity to determine which require immediate attention.
- Identify the assets that need to be protected. This could include sensitive information, customer data, financial information or any other critical assets that are important to the client.

2. **Prepare a Risk Treatment Plan Request:**
- Based on your assessment, draft a formal request for risk treatment, directed to the appropriate departments (e.g., IT, HR, Operations).
- Include clear recommendations for reducing or eliminating the identified risks, such as introducing new security measures, revising policies, or training staff.

3. **Prepare Risk Assessment Report**
 - Create a comprehensive document that details the identified risks, their likelihood and their potential impact on the call center.
- Create a formal request outlining proposed actions to mitigate the risks, tailored for the relevant departments to implement.

Risk Score (R) is calculated as $L \times I$. Risk tolerance dictates that scores of 15-25 (Red) are Intolerable and require immediate treatment.

### 3. Comprehensive Risk Register Summary
The following table summarises all identified risks, their scores, and their potential impact on call centre operations, regulatory compliance, and business continuity.

### 4. Formal Request for High-Priority Risk Treatment (Score >=16)

**TO: Head of IT Infrastructure, Head of Human Resources (HR), Head of Call Centre Operations**
**FROM: [Your Name/GRC Department]**
**SUBJECT: URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Treatment of Extreme Risks (Score>=16)**

This section formally communicates the two Extreme Risks that require immediate, prioritized, and funded treatment plans. The departments listed below are mandated to collaborate to reduce the residual risk score for these items to a score of 8 (High) or lower within the next 6 months.
